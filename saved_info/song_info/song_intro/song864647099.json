    "lyrics": "City of stars\n繁星之城\nAre you shining just for me\n你是否只为我闪耀\nCity of stars\n繁星之城\nThere's so much that I can't see\n世间有太多不可明了\nWho knows\n谁又能明了\nI felt it from the first embrace I shared with you\n我感觉到你我初次相拥时\nThat now our dreams\n所怀有的那些梦想\nThey've finally come true\n不会无疾而终\nCity of stars\n繁星之城\nJust one thing everybody wants\n每个人翘首以盼的\nThere in the bars\n就是那热闹的酒吧中\nAnd through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants\n以及烟雾袅袅的嘈杂餐馆里\nIt's love\n名叫爱的东西\nYes all we're looking for is love from someone else\n是的 人人都想从某个同样孤单的灵魂里找到爱\nA rush a glance a touch a dance\n匆忙一瞥 一曲 一舞\nTo look in somebody's eyes\n从某个人眼中看到的光\nTo light up the skies\n足以将夜空都点亮\nTo open the world and send them reeling\n足以打开世界的新篇章 不复悲伤过往\nA voice that says I'll be here\n好像有某个声音在对我说 我在这里\nAnd you'll be alright\n你也安好\nI don't care if I know\n我不在意自己是否清楚\nJust where I will go\n即将去向哪里\n'Cause all that I need's this crazy feeling\n因为我只想紧紧拥抱这疯狂的爱意\nA rat-tat-tat on my heart\n怦怦跳动的心\nThink I want it to stay\n惟愿爱意永恒\n收起"

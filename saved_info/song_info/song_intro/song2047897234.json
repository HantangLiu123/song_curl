I won’t say it again.”\n是夜幕让我看不见你\n听觉里淡出了声音\n夜幕能闻到你\n却没闻到离开的原因\n你站在镜子另一面和我\n动作不配合but i don wanna control u\n是爱到了极限还是极限的爱\n如此模糊不清\nShe was thrown in a different dimension and her eyes were raining\nWho waste your luv～\nSo he broke into different dimensions but he never found his lover\n她：“Don’t wasted your time”\n他：“I won’t wasted your luv .
